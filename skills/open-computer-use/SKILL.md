# Open Computer Use

## Overview

Open Computer Use exposes Computer Use as a local CLI and stdio MCP server. It is not Codex.app-specific; adapt the commands and MCP config to the agent runtime you are operating in.

This skill documents the `AntonKhakhalin/open-computer-use` fork (a fork of `opensymph/open-computer-use`): in addition to the upstream tool surface it adds native macOS window management (`list_windows`, `get_window`, `get_window_state`, `launch_app`, `activate_window`, window-targeted actions) and a fork-specific install surface. Installing the skill does not install the runtime binary — see [references/installation.md](references/installation.md) for the runtime / MCP / skill distinction.

The macOS runtime requires macOS 14.0 or later. Windows and Linux use their own platform runtimes and are not subject to this macOS minimum.

It supports the same core tool surface across macOS, Linux, and Windows:
`list_apps`, `get_app_state`, `click`, `perform_secondary_action`, `scroll`,
`drag`, `type_text`, `press_key`, and `set_value`. The macOS and Windows
runtimes implement the official Codex `window2` tools: `list_windows`,
`get_window`, `launch_app`, `get_window_state`, and `activate_window`, and the
action tools accept an optional `window` argument (`{app, id, title}` with an
opaque id from `list_windows`/`get_window_state`) plus `screenshotId` for
coordinate actions; on macOS the id is a CGWindowID. `launch_app` launches by
app name or bundle id on macOS (NSWorkspace/LaunchServices: reuse a running
instance, background launch without stealing focus, returns `pid`,
`bundleIdentifier`, `name`, and `windows[]`) and is gated on Windows. On
Linux all five window2 tools return an explicit "not supported yet" error.

## Core Workflow

1. On macOS, run `sw_vers -productVersion` before invoking the CLI and require macOS 14.0 or later. On older versions, explain that the runtime cannot launch; do not recommend `doctor` or permission changes as a fix for binary incompatibility.
2. Check the CLI is installed with `open-computer-use -h` or `ocu -h`. If installation or setup is missing, read [references/installation.md](references/installation.md).
3. On supported macOS versions, run `open-computer-use doctor` before the first real GUI task. If permissions are missing, ask the user to approve Accessibility and Screen Recording in the onboarding UI.
4. Inspect available apps before acting: `open-computer-use call list_apps`.
5. Capture current UI state with `open-computer-use call get_app_state --args '{"app":"TextEdit"}'`. The default state is usually enough for UI operation.
6. When the task needs longer semantic text, such as chat history, email bodies, document text, or long form content, call `get_app_state` with `text_limit: 1000` or `text_limit: "max"`.
7. When visible long pages or lists appear incomplete even after scrolling, call `get_app_state` with a larger `max_tree_nodes` or `max_tree_depth`.
8. Prefer element-targeted actions using `element_index` from the latest `get_app_state` result.
9. For multi-step CLI work, use `open-computer-use call --calls '<json-array>'` so one process can reuse the latest element index mapping.
10. For agent runtimes that support local MCP servers, configure `open-computer-use mcp` or `ocu mcp` and call the exposed Computer Use tools directly. Read [references/usage.md](references/usage.md).
11. If communication, permission, or desktop-session access fails, read [references/troubleshooting.md](references/troubleshooting.md).

## Operating Rules

- Treat the target desktop as the user's real session. Do not inspect password managers, unrelated private content, or sensitive apps unless the user explicitly asked for that task.
- Ask before sending, deleting, purchasing, approving, uploading, or making other externally visible changes.
- Do not assume Codex.app plugin helpers are available. Use the installed `open-computer-use` / `ocu` CLI or an explicit MCP config.
- Always run `get_app_state` (or `get_window_state`) before using `element_index`; do not guess indexes across sessions or after large UI changes.
- Prefer semantic actions and `set_value` for editable controls. Use coordinate `click`, `scroll`, and `drag` only when the element tree does not expose a safer target.
- Never press the Windows/Meta key or chords containing it (`win`, `super`, `cmd`, `meta`, `OS`); the runtime rejects these outright per the official safety policy.
- Never automate terminal apps (Windows Terminal, cmd, PowerShell), password managers, or Windows security apps; the runtime denies these apps regardless of opt-in flags. On Windows the deny list also covers third-party security suites by display name (AVG Internet Security, Avast Premium Security, Bitdefender Security Center).
- Window2 coordinates, screenshot ids, and element indexes are valid only for the observation that produced them; re-observe (`get_window_state`) after any action or error before retrying. In coordinate scroll mode pass `x`/`y` plus `scrollX`/`scrollY` pixel deltas and never `element_index`. On macOS and Windows, coordinate clicks/scrolls/drags additionally require a prior `get_window_state` with `include_screenshot: true` for that window, and are rejected if the window has moved or resized since the observation (re-observe and retry) or the point falls outside the screenshot bounds.
- `mouse_button: "right"` with `click_count >= 2` is rejected on Windows (official policy: right double click is not supported); `type_text` payloads above 8192 UTF-16 code units are rejected — split long text into chunks.
- `launch_app` and `activate_window` on Windows are gated by `OPEN_COMPUTER_USE_WINDOWS_ALLOW_APP_LAUNCH=1` and `OPEN_COMPUTER_USE_WINDOWS_ALLOW_FOCUS_ACTIONS=1` respectively.
- `launch_app` on macOS is not feature-gated, but deny-listed apps (password managers) are never launched, a running instance is reused instead of starting a second one, and the app launches in the background without stealing focus.
- On Windows, `click_method: "global"` (and `input_method: "global"` on `press_key`/`type_text`/`scroll`/`drag`) activates the target window and injects real SendInput events — it moves the mouse pointer and steals keyboard focus. Only use it when the user explicitly opted in via `OPEN_COMPUTER_USE_WINDOWS_ALLOW_FOREGROUND_INPUT=1`; without the flag the runtime returns an explicit gated error.
- On Windows, screenshots prefer Windows.Graphics.Capture (captures the window itself even when occluded, without the OS cursor), falling back to `PrintWindow` and GDI screen copy. Force one backend with `OPEN_COMPUTER_USE_WINDOWS_CAPTURE=wgc|print|gdi` (default `auto`); a forced backend that fails raises an error instead of silently degrading.
- The Windows runtime is a single self-contained Go executable: all 14 tools (UI Automation tree reads, Win32 window-message and SendInput actions, and the WGC/PrintWindow/GDI screenshot chain) run in-process with no PowerShell/.NET dependency. `OPEN_COMPUTER_USE_WINDOWS_BACKEND` no longer selects anything (setting it only prints a one-line deprecation warning). For crash isolation, each tool operation executes in a short-lived child of the same executable and the screenshot chain runs in a grandchild worker; this is internal and invisible to tool callers.
- On macOS, do not enable `OPEN_COMPUTER_USE_ALLOW_GLOBAL_POINTER_FALLBACKS=1` unless the user explicitly requested `click_method: "global"` or other diagnostic behavior that may move the real pointer.
- On Windows and Linux, confirm the command is running inside the logged-in desktop session before assuming GUI automation is available.

## macOS Input Delivery & Background Operation

Controlled-trial findings from macOS 27 (46 trials, per-trial frontmost logging, delivery verified by before/after text diff — see [references/macos-input.md](references/macos-input.md)):

- `type_text` is the first choice for text into editable elements: when the element is settable it uses the AX value-write path, which works on background windows regardless of user activity; only unsettable elements (e.g. terminals) fall back to keyboard input.
- Menu commands: `perform_secondary_action` (`AXPress`) on a menu item element — the macOS `get_app_state` tree includes the menu bar (the window2 `get_window_state` tree does not). It runs without activation and is activity-independent.
- `press_key` chords containing `cmd` are accepted by the macOS runtime and delivered in every observed condition, including to background apps (the Windows/Meta-key rejection in Operating Rules applies to the Windows runtime).
- Plain unmodified `press_key` keys are delivered when the user's input is quiet but **dropped while the user is actively typing** (0/14 vs 28/28 in trials), regardless of window state (foreground/background, visible/hidden, any frontmost app). After posting one to a text target, verify by re-reading the text state; if dropped, retry after a short pause or switch to `type_text`.
- Flagged single keys (`shift+a`) and the gated global-HID `input` path are unreliable on macOS (context-dependent / dropped in all observed conditions) — prefer the paths above.
- Background operation without activation: element clicks, `set_value`, `type_text`, `AXPress`, and app-targeted `press_key` all work without stealing focus. Use `activate_window` only when the task requires the foreground, and return focus to the user's app afterward.
- New windows of background apps pop to the front of the global stack at creation (macOS 27; private SkyLight reordering APIs are ignored from CLI processes). To create a window without a visible pop-up, create and hide it in one AppleScript call (`make new document` + System Events `set visible to false`); input delivery to the hidden app still works, and `set visible to true` restores without stealing focus.
- After a binary rebuild, TCC grants can go stale per launch context (launchd silently loses Accessibility; the shell context usually keeps working). If AX behavior degrades after a rebuild, re-run from the interactive shell or re-grant before suspecting code.

## Common CLI Actions

```sh
open-computer-use -h
ocu -h
open-computer-use doctor
open-computer-use call list_apps
ocu call list_apps
open-computer-use call get_app_state --args '{"app":"TextEdit"}'
open-computer-use call get_app_state --args '{"app":"TextEdit","text_limit":1000}'
open-computer-use call get_app_state --args '{"app":"TextEdit","text_limit":"max"}'
open-computer-use call get_app_state --args '{"app":"Google Chrome","max_tree_nodes":3000,"max_tree_depth":96}'
open-computer-use call click --args '{"app":"TextEdit","element_index":"0"}'
open-computer-use call type_text --args '{"app":"TextEdit","text":"Hello from Open Computer Use"}'
```

For a short sequence that reuses state in one process:

```sh
open-computer-use call --calls '[
  {"tool":"get_app_state","args":{"app":"TextEdit"}},
  {"tool":"press_key","args":{"app":"TextEdit","key":"Return"}}
]'
```

Window2 flow (multi-window / modal targeting; opaque window id = HWND on Windows, CGWindowID on macOS):

```sh
open-computer-use call list_windows
open-computer-use call get_window_state --args '{"window":{"app":"Notepad","id":1051836},"include_text":true}'
open-computer-use call click --args '{"window":{"id":1051836},"x":40,"y":20}'
open-computer-use call scroll --args '{"window":{"id":1051836},"x":200,"y":200,"scrollY":600}'
open-computer-use call activate_window --args '{"window":{"app":"Safari","id":51234}}'
```

## MCP Usage

For runtimes that can launch local MCP servers over stdio, use:

```toml
[mcp_servers.open_computer_use]
command = "open-computer-use"
args = ["mcp"]
```
